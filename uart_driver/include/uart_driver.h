/**
 * @file uart_driver.h
 * @brief UartDriver class for handling UART communication with interrupt-based management.
 *
 * This header file defines the UartDriver class, which provides an interface for UART communication
 * on the RP2040 microcontroller using the Pico SDK. The driver supports configuration of UART parameters,
 * such as baud rate, parity, and stop bits, and manages data transmission and reception through circular buffers.
 *
 * The class includes interrupt handlers for UART events (data received, errors, etc.) and a repeating timer
 * for periodic checks. It is designed to be used with FreeRTOS, allowing integration with RTOS tasks for
 * efficient asynchronous communication.
 *
 * The driver also supports custom task notifications to signal events and buffer management, making it
 * suitable for real-time applications that require responsive and low-latency UART communication.
